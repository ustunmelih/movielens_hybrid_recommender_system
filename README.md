## Business Case

The film industry relies on recommendation systems to deliver engaging and personalized content to viewers. These systems suggest films that align with users' preferences and past viewing habits. This project aims to generate 10 tailored film recommendations for a specific user, utilizing both item-based and user-based recommendation methods.

## The story of the dataset

The dataset is provided by MovieLens, a film recommendation service. It contains films along with their corresponding rating scores. There are 2,000,263 ratings across 27,278 films. This dataset was created on October 17, 2016, and includes data from 138,493 users between January 9, 1995, and March 31, 2015. All users were selected randomly, and it is noted that each selected user has rated at least 20 films.
